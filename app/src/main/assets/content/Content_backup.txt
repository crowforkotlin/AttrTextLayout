van gogh's starry sky
His name is Van Gogh, a painter obsessed with painting. His dream is to use his own colors and brushstrokes to express his feelings and understanding of the world and create a unique artistic style. He often walked out of his house at night and looked up at the stars in the sky, feeling their light and beauty.
One day he stayed in a hotel in Arles. He found an empty room, from which he could see a vast starry sky. He decided to paint a picture of the starry sky in that room as his homage and praise for nature. He took out the canvas and paint and began his creation. He used thick brushstrokes and bright colors to depict every detail of the starry sky. His fingers moved quickly on the canvas, his eyes were lost in the painting, and his mind was flying in the painting.
He painted all night until dawn. He put down his brush, took a few steps back, and admired his work. He felt that it was his best painting and he felt proud and satisfied with himself. He wanted to show this painting to others so that they could also feel his emotions and imagination. He walked out of the room and went to find the owner of the hotel.
He knocked on the front desk of the hotel and a young man came out. When the young man saw Van Gogh, he smiled and said, "Good morning, sir. Did you sleep well?"
Van Gogh said: "Good morning, sir. I slept well, thank you. I want to show you a painting that I painted in your room last night."
The young man said, "Oh, are you a painter? What kind of painting do you want to show me?"
Van Gogh said: "Please come with me, I want to show you a painting of a starry sky."
The young man said, "Okay, sir. I'll go with you."
Van Gogh led the young man to the room, opened the door, pointed to the painting on the wall and said, "I painted this. I want to give it to you. I hope you like it."
The young man looked at the painting on the wall, a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes, and then said, "Did you paint this?"
Van Gogh said: "Yes, I painted this. Do you like it?"
The young man said: "I like it very much, sir. It is a very beautiful painting, and you are a very talented painter. But, do you know, how much is this painting worth?"
Van Gogh said: "No, I don't know. I just want to paint the starry sky in my heart. I don't care about its value."
The young man said: "Don't you care about its value? Do you know that this painting can be sold for millions of euros or even more. This is a priceless treasure. You can't just give it to me. You should keep it well." , or sell it to a wealthy collector, or donate it to a famous museum, so that people all over the world can see your painting, and your name will be immortal."
Van Gogh said: "Really? Are you kidding?"
The young man said: "I am not joking, sir. I am an art connoisseur and I have a keen eye for art. I can tell you for sure that this painting is a masterpiece and it will change the history of art. It It will make you a great painter, and your name will be as famous as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Picasso and other masters."
